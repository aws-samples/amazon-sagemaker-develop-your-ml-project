    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers.  Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer.  Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an example problem to predict if a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank, after one or more phone calls.  The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preparing your Amazon SageMaker notebook\n",
    "* Downloading data from the internet into Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "* Investigating and transforming the data so that it can be fed to Amazon SageMaker algorithms\n",
    "* Prepare the data to train an XGBoost model.\n",
    "* Estimating a model using the Gradient Boosting algorithm\n",
    "* Evaluating the effectiveness of the model\n",
    "* Setting the model up to make on-going predictions\n",

    "When building a model whose primary goal is to predict a target value on new data, it is important to understand overfitting.  Supervised learning models are designed to minimize error between their predictions of the target value and actuals, in the data they are given.  This last part is key, as frequently in their quest for greater accuracy, machine learning models bias themselves toward picking up on minor idiosyncrasies within the data they are shown.  These idiosyncrasies then don't repeat themselves in subsequent data, meaning those predictions can actually be made less accurate, at the expense of more accurate predictions in the training phase.\n",

There are several different ways of operationalizing this, holdout validation, cross-validation, leave-one-out validation, etc.  For our purposes, we'll simply randomly split the data into 3 uneven groups.  The model will be trained on 70% of data, it will then be evaluated on 20% of data to give us an estimate of the accuracy we hope to have on \"new\" data, and 10% will be held back as a final testing dataset which will be used later on."
